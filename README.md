# Weight App
Weight App is a simple weight tracking android app. You simply add your weight logs using either a current or past date, and a graph and chart will help show you your progress and goals. The app is currently live on the [Google Play Store](https://github.com/TYohoJr/eyeTracker-server).

## Features
* Line graph of all weight logs
* Chart with several stats to show progress/goals
* Add weight log option
* Remove any specific log from the past

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing
To run the app locally first fork this respository and clone it onto your machine. Instructions on how to do that can be found [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo).

Once in the project install the necessary dependencies by running

```
npm install
```
You now have all the files needed to run the project locally.

### Running A Device

In order to locally run a development server you will either need an android device to plug into your machine, or run an emulator. Help getting that running can be found [here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).

## Deployment
To deploy the project locally after installing dependencies and setting up your device/emulator run

```
react-native run-android
```

The app should start installing on the device and open automatically once finished.
